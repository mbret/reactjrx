# reactjrx

`reactjrx` is an innovative library designed to bridge RxJS and React, offering developers a powerful set of tools to integrate observables into their React applications seamlessly.

It simplifies the reactive programming approach by providing easy-to-use bindings for observing and reacting to data changes, coupled with advanced state management and queries helpers akin to `react-query` for handling effects, mutations, and asynchronous data fetching.

Tailored for projects where RxJS is a core dependency, `reactjrx` enhances the development experience by enabling more dynamic, efficient, and responsive UIs, making it an essential addition for developers looking to leverage the full potential of RxJS within their React applications.
